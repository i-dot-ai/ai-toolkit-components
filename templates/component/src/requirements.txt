# Python dependencies for COMPONENT_NAME  # TODO: replace COMPONENT_NAME
#
# List one package per line. These are installed at image build time,
# and also copied to the mounted volume on first run so that users can
# add extra packages without rebuilding the image — just append to this
# file and restart the container.
#
# TODO: add your component's dependencies below
# Examples:
# requests
# pyyaml
# fastapi
